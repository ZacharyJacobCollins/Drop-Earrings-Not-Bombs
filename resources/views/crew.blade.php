						Hiba is the youngest participant in the Drop Earrings Not Bombs project. She left her home in Aleppo for Istanbul with her family in 2013. She was 13 years old at the time, the second of five siblings. For two years she attended Al-Nokhba, a makeshift school for Syrian refugees. However, now at 16 years of age, the school does not offer any classes at her grade level. Instead, she regularly attends courses at Small Projects Istanbul where she has a new community of friends and learning opportunities. She is interested in becoming an interior designer.

						<span>Zeyna, Lin, Qotaiba and Mahmoud</span>
						Zeyna, Lin, Qotaiba and Mahmoud are all from the same family, made Istanbul their home four years ago. Back in Syria Mahmoud was, among many things, a jeweler, designing his own creations with his wife Zeyna at night and selling them in his shop during the day. When the bombs started to hit the city they lived in, Mahmoud travelled alone to Istanbul where he found work as a tour guide. After securing a home for his family, Mahmoud's parents, wife Zeyna, and their two children came to join him. Eventually so did his 6 brothers and their wives, including Lin and Qotaiba. Most of the brothers were able to earn a decent living in the tourism industry until the terror incident that occurred in January. Now they are very active in the Drop Earrings Not Bombs project, especially Mahmoud who plays an integral role in communicating and coordinating the work with project participants, as well as handling shipping.
